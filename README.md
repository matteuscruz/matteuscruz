## Hi 👋, I'm Mateus Cruz  

🎓 Ph.D. Candidate in Telecommunications | 🤖 AI Researcher | 🌱 Computer Vision & IoT Enthusiast  

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Telecommunications at the Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações (Inatel), Brazil, with a strong background in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Embedded Systems. My academic and professional journey is driven by the application of AI to solve real-world problems, especially in **Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Federated Learning, IoT, and Edge Computing**.

I hold degrees in **Industrial Automation, Computer Science, Telecommunications (MSc), and an MBA in Data Science**. Over the years, I have accumulated solid experience developing intelligent systems that integrate **data acquisition, processing, and decision-making**, often deployed on **embedded or distributed environments**.

Currently, my research focuses on:
- **Computer Vision for medical, agricultural, and maritime applications**
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, including explainable AI
- **Federated Learning and privacy-preserving AI**
- **IoT platforms, wireless sensor networks, and LoRa communication**
- **AI at the Edge and Embedded Systems**

I am also actively involved in **teaching activities**, **student co-supervision**, and **scientific dissemination**, contributing to both academic and applied research environments.
